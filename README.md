# **Authentication Token Interception Program**

This project demonstrates how authentication tokens can be intercepted and stored by setting up a proxy to monitor network traffic. It leverages **mitmproxy** to intercept sensitive data from backend requests (like `/oauth/token`), showcasing potential security vulnerabilities that can arise in unprotected networks. The project stores intercepted tokens in **Redis** and is intended solely for educational and security awareness purposes.

**Note:** This project is designed to raise awareness about the importance of secure coding practices and network security. It should not be used for unauthorized access or malicious activities.

## **Project Overview**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how insecure network practices can lead to the interception of sensitive data, such as authentication tokens. By simulating a **man-in-the-middle** (MITM) attack, this project highlights the importance of secure communication channels, HTTPS, and token handling.

This project uses **mitmproxy** to intercept HTTP/HTTPS requests sent to a backend authentication endpoint and extracts tokens or credentials from the intercepted data. The extracted tokens are then stored in **Redis** for analysis or further testing.

## **Features**

- **Proxy Interception with mitmproxy**: Intercepts traffic for specified endpoints (e.g., `/oauth/token`).
- **Redis Integration**: Stores intercepted tokens for secure handling and testing.
- **Custom Authentication**: Supports basic proxy authentication for controlled access.
- **Detailed Logging**: Logs intercepted data and authentication results for debugging and educational purposes.
